# Real-Time Email Spam Detection

I am pretty sure that I won't be able to complete this project as I literally know nothing about Kafka, I'll be learning while working on this project and trying to complete it. I will be using the Gmail API that ingests new emails and sends them to Kafka as streams for processing and inference, if the email is classified as spam it would be deleted.


## The Pipeline

This is the system architecture that I will be following for this project. I'm pretty sure it will change as I learn more about Kafka and how to use it.
