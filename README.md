# Real-Time Email Spam Detection

I am pretty sure that I won't be able to complete this project as I literally know nothing about Kafka, I'll be learning while working on this project and trying to complete it. I will be using the Gmail API that ingests new emails and sends them to Kafka as streams for processing and inference, if the email is classified as spam it would be deleted.
